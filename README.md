What can this bot do?

When developing our bot service, we wanted to be able to add our bot to the chat of a conditional restaurant, from which users could access it.

Programming languages used when writing a project.
---------------------------
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Nikita535)](https://github.com/Nikita535/Bot)

The main programming language, as you can see, is python. We chose this particular language because it is the most suitable for writing bots for Telegram.


We used the following libraries:
* ___Aiogram___ - aiogram is a pretty simple and fully asynchronous framework for Telegram Bot API written in Python 3.7 with asyncio and aiohttp. It helps you to make your bots faster and simpler.
* ___Requests___ - When solving various tasks in the field of web development, we often need to interact with HTTP. This is not the easiest task for any programming language, and Python is no exception. The language, of course, contains built-in modules that allow you to send HTTP requests.
* ___Beautiful Soup___ - beautiful soup is a Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to give you natural ways to navigate, search, and modify the parse tree. It usually saves programmers hours and days of work.
* ___Lxml___ - lxml is arguably the best Python parsing library. Differs in high speed and power, "relatively easy" to use.
The library is developed and supported by experts from the python community. Therefore, it has all the qualities of a suitable libra for parsing: it conforms to XML standards, it is correct with invalid HTML code, it works fast, it is safe and multifunctional.

Requirements
-------
Before starting, make sure you have a Python interpreter of at least version 3.6 installed. версия библиотеки aiogram(1.1).

---

Cloud service
---

Our bot is located on the cloud service - Heroku, as it seemed to us the most convenient for hosting a python project.
That is why the file structure of the project contains such files as:
* ___Procfile___  - heroku apps include a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. 
* ___Requirements.txt___ - files with project dependencies for the stable operation of programs on the cloud.
